          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
          <p>
            I automated a data compilation task, boosting efficiency by 75%
            (cutting work time from 4 hours to 1 hour) using Python. The
            solution was passed on to my successor when I left the company.
          </p>
          <p>-----</p>
          <p>
            Back in 2020, my manager resigned, assigning me one of his crucial
            tasks: updating weekly global sales forecasts in our database.
            Although a straightforward process, it demanded meticulous attention
            to detail for zero error tolerance.
          </p>
          <p>
            My former manager manually collected and compiled data using Excel
            for years. At that time, I’ve only known some libraries such as
            Panda, NumPy and Selenium. I thought it would be a great opportunity
            to write a script to handle data cleansing and compilation, all the
            time left I can work on actual analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is worth mentioning, every single excel file was not formatted
            the same, it is obviously difficult to force everyone to use the
            exact same excel template when such process is not conducted in the
            system.
          </p>
          <p>-----</p>
          <p>
            Using FreeForm, I created a simple data flow to compare the
            potential automation workload. The Python Script really helped me
            eliminate human errors and made it easier for me to accommodate last
            minute changes requested by data owners.
          </p>

          <p>-----</p>
          <p>
            I used Panda to read and cleanse data, such as renaming the data,
            pivoting, unpivoting, string slicing, and creating a standard format
            that includes metadata such as date, region and version. I also used
            glob and os libraries to do the final consolidation of the cleaned
            files.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end, my weekly task can be done as quickly in less than 20
            minutes. Most of the time I spent was on downloading and uploading
            files to Jupyter notebook, and doing sanity check.
          </p>
          <p><strong>My takeaway:</strong></p>
          <p>
            Beyond my past experiences, this project opened up unlimited
            possibilities for learning. Breaking out of my comfort zone was
            essential, and the moment I demonstrated to my ex-colleague that one
            click could achieve what once took an hour, I felt extremely proud
            and happy—a moment that continues to drive me forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've saved some screenshots of the script with blurred sensitive
            information.
