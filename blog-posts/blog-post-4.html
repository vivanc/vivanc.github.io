            I wanted to understand the difference between the 4 so here's my note:
            <ul>
              <li>
                'nav'' is a html like tag in jsx, is acts as a tag
              </li>
              <li>
                'navLink' is similar to 'nav' tag but with more functionality, it can set the link to active or inactive to style it when user is on the link
              </li>
              <li>
                'navigate' is a component in react-router-dom, it takes user to the 'to' attribute link as you set it. It has 3 attributes: to="/dashboard" && state={{}} && replace={true}. state && replace (boolean) both attributes are optional. state lets you to pass prop to the component to render. replace gives you session that user was on before.
              </li>
              <li>
                'useNavigate' is a hook that was shipped with react router version 6. it is essentially the same as navigate, however navigate exists so ES6 can use navigat with class-based react components, because ES6 does not support hooks.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
