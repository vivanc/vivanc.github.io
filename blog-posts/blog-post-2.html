            Background information: Me and my good friend Jessie are working on
            a recipe colleciton website, and I am determined to document what
            I've learned step by step, and hopefully at the end of the project,
            the dots can all be connected.

          <p>Nav Bar</p>
          <p>
            We seperated UI and backend, this week I am working on the
            presentation of the Home Page, nav bar on the left side and recipe
            cards on the right side. When it comes to bootstrap, it is fairly
            easy but I was stuck on the question of toggle (responsive) and flex
            vs. grid. I have come to understand the different usage on flexbox
            and grid, and one thing that is a key distingusher is the way that
            flexbox default is ROW, so whatever is inside the flexbox is going
            to be broken down to columns, and it is intrinsic sizing, so that
            each box is just perfectly wrapped the size of the content. However,
            it is often used childeren styles to further style each children
            box.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am also more familiar with bootstrap syntax on basic styles such
            as py-3 (padding top bottom level 3) and mt-2 (margin top level 2)
            and h3 (font size) h-100 (define the height of the row)
          </p>

          <p>
            I also realized there are bootstrap and react-bootstrap. You need to
            import react-bootstrap components to use them but when you render in
            the browser it is wrapped in 'class'. The other way to use bootstrap
            is to use normal react jsx using className and define the boostray
            style languages inside it.
